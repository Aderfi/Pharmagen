In vitro assays measured upregulation of CD107a on CD8 T cells in cultures of T cell lines (TCLs) generated from lymphocytes from allopurinol-naive individuals with a HLA-B*58:01 (n=7) positive or negative (n=7) genotype. Allopurinol or oxypurinol (an active metabolite of allopurinol)-specific TCLs were generated by incubating lymphocytes with different concentrations of drug (1, 10 or 100 ug/mL).

Patients with HCV genotype 1 were divided into groups receiving dual therapy (GT1 (d); peg-intron alpha 2a/b, ribavirn) or triple therapy (GT1 (t); peg-intron alpha 2a/b, ribavirn, telaprevir). Sustained virological response (SVR) is a measure of therapeutic efficacy. Variables that were significant in univariate analysis were included in the multivariate analysis. The authors designated three ""beneficial"" genotypes that were found at higher frequencies in patients who achieved SVR: rs12979860 CC, rs8099917 TT, rs368234815 TT/TT. These genotypes were often found together. 98% of patients with GT1 (d), 100% of patients with GT1(t), 96% of patients with HCV genotype 2, 92% of patients with HCV genotype 3 and 98% of patients with HCV genotype 4 had those genotype combinations.; rs368234815 TT/TT was the only single SNP significant predictor of SVR in patients with HCV genotype 3.  Although rs368234815 TT/TT was significantly associated with SVR in univariate analysis, in a multivariate analysis of predictive factors of SVR within all genotype 1 infected patients the TT/TT genotype was not found to be significant. The TT/TT genotype was also associated with increases ALT levels in patients with HCV genotype 2 (p=0.018),3 (p=0.035) and 2/3 (p=0.006) as well as a higher HCV RNA concentration at baseline in GT1 (d) (p<0.001) and GT(t) patients (p=0.007). *Note: TT is a single allele whereas the other allele substitutes TT for a single G so the WT genotype is TT/TT.";Genotype TT/TT is associated with increased response to peginterferon alfa-2a, peginterferon alfa-2b, ribavirin or telaprevir in people with Hepatitis C, Chronic as compared to genotypes G/TT + GG.;or in people with Disease:Chronic hepatitis C virus infection
