All patients were confirmed to have opioid dependence syndrome, as assessed by DSM-IV diagnostic criteria. Patients with two or more types of mental illness or substance abuse were excluded from the study. The phenotype that was quantified was ""duration from transition from first use to dependence"" (DTFUD) and was measured in days. Briefly, the duration of initial opioid use to first occurrence of dependence syndrome was assessed by an interviewer and verified by an independent psychiatrist.
