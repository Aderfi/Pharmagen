The article used comparisons of HLA-DR and HLA-DQ heterodimer protein pairings and reasoned that the HLA-DRB1*07:01 allele (HLA-DR7) provided the simplest causal association, and thus it was selected as the risk predictive biomarker.

Patients might be additionally  treated with Beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and/or statins. Aspirin (100 mg/day) was prescribed indefinitely, and clopidogrel (75 mg/day) for 12 months. At discharge from the hospital admission following the primary intervention, aspirin and clopidogrel were prescribed to 96.0% and 99.7% of the patients respectively. However, all patients received the loading of clopidogrel.

In the TRAINING SET, in univariate analysis, patients who carried the A allele had a significantly shorter median progression-free survival (PFS) as compared to those with the GG genotype (13.9 vs 16.3 months), as well as a shorter overall survival (29.5 vs 41.1 months).

In VALIDATION COHORT B, in univariate analysis, patients who carried the A allele also had a significantly shorter PFS as compared to those with the GG genotype (9.0 vs 12.4 months); this remained significant in multivariable analysis.

This SNP panel included common coding variants and haplotypes detected in eight and three nAChR subunit genes found in European American populations. In the 2,827 long-term smokers examined, common susceptibility and protective haplotypes at the CHRNA5-A3-B4 locus were associated with nicotine dependence severity in subjects who began daily smoking at or before the age of 16, an exposure period that results in a more severe form of adult nicotine dependence. The haplotype (CCAGA) containing rs680244, rs569207, rs16969968, rs578776, rs1051730 SNPs and the C allele or another haplotype with the C allele (CTGAG) were associated with nicotine dependence severity.

Among them, the association between the rs45574836 (exm1401859) SNP and vomiting that was found in CIH samples was replicated in JUH samples (Table 5). The results suggested that carriers of the minor A allele of the rs45574836 SNP in the ATP8B3 gene region that leads to a missense mutation were more vulnerable to vomiting, and, thus, tended to experience vomiting more often than noncarriers during the postoperative period (Table 4 and Table 5).
