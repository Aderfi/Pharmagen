1450372355;VORICONAZOLE;CYP2C19;*2;CYP2C19*1, CYP2C19*2;METABOLISM/PK;DECREASED;CLEARANCE OF;;;CYP2C19 *2 is associated with decreased clearance of voriconazole in insect microsomes as compared to CYP2C19 *1.;Caution: The annotation encompasses several constructs named as *2 sub alleles due to different variants.  Those amino acid changes might or not be together with rs4244285 and /or rs12769205 in the construct. No information about the gene construct generation used for the assay is reported, although the table 1 states the splicing in the effect column. However, if all construct had the same splicing variant the range of clearance is unexpected and the variants are located after the splicing event in the sequence. For those amino acid changes currently exists no rsID to use to annotate. The article names the construct *2H (H396D), *2J (K421Q) however it is not clear if it carries other *2 variants such as the signature splice variant. There is no comparison *2 construct. However there is a *3 construct that results in no detectable enzyme activity, while *3C has a detectable clearance. Intrinsic clearance is Vmax/Km. For K421Q, voriconazole clearance was 20.78% of *1 (no variant). For H396D, metabolite concentrations of voriconazole were below the detection limit, so kinetic parameters could not be determined, indicating null function.

The G allele was associated with a decreased sensitivity to the cytotoxic effects of MTX (little change in cell proliferation or cell viability upon exposure to MTX). At increasing MTX concentration the GG genotype was also associated with decreased SOD2 protein activity and increased SOD2 gene expression.  The ratio of anti-apoptotic/pro-apoptotic gene expression (BAX/Bcl2) was lowest in cells with the AG and GG genotype and highest in the AA genotype cells, indicating that the  AA genotype had an increased sensitivity to the cytotoxic effects of MTX. Markers of oxidative stress (gene expression of genes involved in oxidative stress, protein carbonylation, lipid peroxidation and ROS levels) were also observed. DNA damage did not differ significantly between groups. The GG genotype showed evidence of decreased oxidative stress upon exposure to MTX. Note: the authors refer to this polymorphism (rs4880) as Ala16Val and each allele as A for alanine or V for valine. The correct AA change is Val16Ala and A>G. Therefore the genotypes in this annotation were determined by the amino acid change that was stated in the study (e.g. in the study the V allele is listed here as the A allele and the A allele is listed here as the G allele).
